# Observer

•The ISubject interface defines methods for attaching and detaching IObserver objects, as well as a method for notifying all IObserver objects of changes (Notify).

•The IObserver interface defines a method for receiving updates from the ISubject (Update).

•The WeatherData class is a concrete implementation of the ISubject interface. It maintains a list of IObserver objects and provides methods for adding and removing observers. When its internal state changes, it calls Notify to notify all registered observers of the changes.

•The CurrentConditionsDisplay class is a concrete implementation of the IObserver interface. It registers itself as an observer of the WeatherData subject and implements the Update method to display the latest temperature and humidity values.

With this implementation, you can create instances of WeatherData and CurrentConditionsDisplay, and observe how changes to the WeatherData object are automatically reflected in the CurrentConditionsDisplay. This demonstrates how the Observer pattern can be used.
